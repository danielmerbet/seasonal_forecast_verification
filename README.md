## Features

- **Skill Metrics**: Evaluate forecasts using common metrics like:
  - Correlation (e.g., Pearson, Spearman)
  - Continuous Ranked Probability Skill Score (CRPSS)
- **Visualization**: 
  - Time series comparisons
  - Scatter plots
  - Heatmap of skill 
- **Flexible Analysis**: Customizable for various datasets, regions, variables, and temporal scales.
- **Support for Observations**: Integrate observational or reanalysis data for benchmarking.

## Installation
